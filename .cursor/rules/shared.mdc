# AI Rules for Cultura

Project Cultura is an application that allows users to create, edit, and share profile cards showcasing their cultural interests. The app uses a single, predefined template with specific themes and colors, making it easy to quickly create a card without the need for additional customization. Users can register, log in, and modify their cards, then share them via a unique link. The MVP version aims to test whether users regularly update their cards and share them on external platforms.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Use feedback from linters to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
